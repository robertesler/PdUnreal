# PdUnreal
A demonstration of how to use Pd++ with Unreal Engine 5 and Metasounds
Currently, in development.  If you really want to try it right now create a new Plugin in Unreal.  Make sure to add the folowing to your .uplugin file:
```
    "Plugins": [
 
        {
 
            "Name": "Metasound",
 
            "Enabled": true
 
        }
 
    ]
```
Then you can copy the source to your project.  Hopefully it will work.  
Coming soon: tutorials, more examples and a much better readme file. : )
